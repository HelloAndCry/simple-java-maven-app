# simple-java-maven-app

This repository is forked from [Jenkins-docs/simple-java-maven-app](https://github.com/jenkins-docs/simple-java-maven-app) and add `.travis.yml` for Travis-CI.

Please fork this repo and add a .travis.yml file to your repository to tell Travis CI what to do. There are some examples in branch `travis`.

The repository contains a simple Java application which outputs the string
"Hello world!" and is accompanied by a couple of unit tests to check that the
main application works as expected. The results of these tests are saved to a
JUnit XML report.
